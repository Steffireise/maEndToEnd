Description: In this article, we walk through an end--to--end Affymetrix microarray differential
    expression workflow using Bioconductor packages. This workflow is directly 
    applicable to current "Gene" type arrays, e.g. the HuGene or MoGene arrays
    but can easily adapted to  similar platforms.
    The data re-analyzed is a typical clinical microarray data set that 
    compares inflammed and non--inflammed colon tissue in two disease subtypes.
    We will start from the raw data CEL files, show how to import them into a 
    Bioconductor ExpressionSet, perform quality control and normalization and finally
    differential gene expression (DE) analysis, followed by some enrichment 
    analysis. As experimental designs can be complex, a self contained introduction 
    to linear models is also part of the workflow.
